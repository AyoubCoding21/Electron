        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Electron!</h3>
        <p>
           Electron is a dynamic and innovative club dedicated to producing high-quality open-source software in various programming languages such as C++, GLSL, JS, and more. Our primary goal is to replace defective software and other technological solutions with reliable and efficient alternatives. 
            </br>
            Our team of young software programmers, are working on various projects to replace old and defective software and also find bugs in exsisting software and ways to optimise it, but we also make new software projects.
            <br>
            At Electron, we believe in the power of teamwork and open-source software, so that people - like you - can see how our software is made and try to find ways to optimize it.
            <br>
            We also make partnerships with other companies, i. e. : We made a few months ago a partnership with xiCreations and Stupid Boards to make brand new products, whether hardware or software, and it's going really well so far.
            <br>
            Join Electron now and be part of a vibrant community that will ensure that all software is secure, while still publishing free and open-source software and all of that, with loads of fun on the way.
