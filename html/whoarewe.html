        Who are we ?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Positron was created by an idea of 2 young middle-school students, one of them is Ayoub Lakrad, a 13 year old programmer.
        </br>
        The early goal of the club was to make side-hustles. But later, they made a mainstream club to replace defectuous software.
        </br>
        It was created in summer 2022.
        </br>
        Later on, in the end of 2023, Positron partnershipped with xiCreations, and in 2024, with Stupid Boards. And xiCreations and SB have a website of their own while Positron is producing this one.
