        Who are we ?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Electron was created by an idea of 2 small middle-school students, one of them is Ayoub Lakrad, a 12 year old talented programmer (the CEO of that company was him).
        </br>
        The early goal of the club was to make side-hustles. But later, they made a mainstream club to replace defectuous software.
        </br>
        It was created in summer 2022.
        </br>
        Later on, in the end of 2023, Electron partnershipped with xiCreations, and in 2024, with Stupid Boards, they were called the xiElectron Boards trio company. And xiCreations and SB have a website of their own while Electron is producing this one.
